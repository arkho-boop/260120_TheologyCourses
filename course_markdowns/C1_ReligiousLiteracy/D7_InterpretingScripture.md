## Welcome to Day 7

WELCOME TO DAY 7! 

Today we'll be exploring the role of interpretation of scripture through examples focused first on women and religion and second on religion and science.  Through these case studies, issues related to power, situatedness, and authority all arise and we look forward to hearing your responses to the examples provided.

## Activity: Interpretive Voices

ACTIVITY: INTERPRETIVE VOICES

In our study of religion throughout the entire six month series,  we will often pause to reflect on the question "How do you know what you know?" At the start of this session, let's reflect on this question with a particular emphasis on interpretive voices. Whether or not you identify within a faith tradition, reflect on whose voices you hear most frequently or significantly regarding religion in general and the meaning of scripture specifically in your own, personal context. This might include politicians, faith leaders, media representatives, teachers, families members, or others. Which voices are amplified in your context and why? 

## Examples: Women's Voices

WOMEN'S VOICES

In the first part of today’s session, you will read and hear formative women’s interpretive voices in Hindu, Muslim, Christian, and Jewish tradition. Start by watching **minutes 5:50 - 9:36** of Fakhra Salimi's interview with Professor Leila Ahmed in the video below. Professor Ahmed is an Egyptian-American scholar who came to Harvard in 1999 as the first professor of women's studies in religion. She is now  the Victor S. Thomas Professor of Divinity and the author of the now classic text,  Women and Gender in Islam: Historical Roots of a Modern Debate. In this clip, she talks about her understanding of the relationship between scripture and diverse interpretative voices.

## Women's Voices: Case Studies

CASE STUDIES OF WOMEN'S VOICES IN HINDU, ISLAMIC, CHRISTIAN, AND JEWISH TRADITIONS

Here you will find more resources highlighting women's interpretive voices in multiple traditions. Choose **two** of these examples to focus on, though of course you are welcome to explore them all! As you watch and read, consider the particular interpretive work each of these voices represents. What other interpretive voices in their traditions are they in conversation with? How do their own situated identities and contexts, as well as the larger frameworks of power, influence their interpretive work? Scroll all the way down to see the full array of options.  In addition to textual excerpts of their work, there are videos of the presentations of Delores Williams and Judith Plaskow at the conference on Religion and the Feminist Movement held at the Harvard Divinity School in 2002.  (See [here](http://wsrp.hds.harvard.edu/news/past-conferences/religion-and-feminist-movement-conference-2002) for a full program of that conference and video links to other speakers.)

**An Example from Hindu Tradition**
At this point in the course you have read several reflections on diversity in traditions of the Ramayana. In this reading you will focus on specific examples of women's narrative framings as described in Velcheru Narayana Rao’s chapter “[A Ramayana of Their Own: Women’s Oral Tradition in Telugu](http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3j49n8h7&chunk.id=d0e7108&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e7108&brand=ucpress)” in *Many Ramayanas: A Diversity of Narrative Tradition in South Asia*. Review the introduction to this book for more in-depth discussion of the context for these women's narratives. 

**An Example from Islamic Tradition** 
Amina Wadud is an American born scholar of Islam who wrote a widely influential text entitled *Qur'an and Women: Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman's Perspective* that was published by Oxford University Press in 1999. She is also the co-founder of the Sisters in Islam group that we encountered in Day  One and who are located in Malaysia. Please read this statement from her entitled: "[Islam Beyond Patriarchy Through Gender Inclusive Qur’anic Analysis](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/da86f255bfe27301223a120ffdaf4cc9/asset-v1:HarvardX+HDS3221.1x+3T2024+type@asset+block/Islam_Beyond_Patriarchy.pdf)".

**An Example from Christian Tradition**
Delores S. Williams is a pivotal figure in the development of “Womanist” theology, rooted in the experience of African-American women. **Please read Chapter 1** of "[Sisters in the Wilderness](https://books.google.com/books?id=4LiIAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sister+in+the+Wilderness+Delores+Williams&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVq_7Y_NTLAhVFVj4KHbZSD4MQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=Sister%20in%20the%20Wilderness%20Delores%20Williams&f=false)", in which Williams develops a reading of the Biblical figure of Hagar, mother of Ishmael, as a cornerstone of this work. For additional context on Williams' life and work, [watch her talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hltJgzbXPFI) at the conference on Religion and the Feminist Movement. 

**An Example from Jewish Tradition**
Judith Plaskow is a Jewish theologian, Professor of Religious Studies at Manhattan College, and a pioneer in the field of feminist theology. Read **pages 1-31** from her 1991 volume, "[Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective](https://books.google.com/books?id=mJX78S4ejiAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Standing+Again+at+Sinai:+Judaism+from+a+Feminist+Perspective&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjv0rr5xInLAhVBFz4KHWNyBOkQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false)". For additional context on Plaskow's life and work, [watch her talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1sK5SG0Ons) at the conference on Religion and the Feminist Movement. 

## Discussion: Women's Voices

DISCUSSION: WOMEN'S VOICES

For your discussion post, please reflect on the two examples of women's interpretive voices that you focused on, in conversation with one another.  First discuss how you would characterize the approach to textual interpretation in each of the two examples. What similarities and differences did you see? 
Second, in each example, what is the relationship between the women's interpretive voices and larger structures of power? What other interpretive voices are they in conversation with? How are their voices amplified or constrained within the larger context within which they are working?  Please post your responses in the Discussion board and respond to the posts of two of your peers.

## Examples: Climate Change

DIVERSE EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN VIEWS ON CLIMATE CHANGE

Please view the following two positions about climate change representing two perspectives within the United States Evangelical Christian Community.   As you do so, please take note of the similarities and differences represented, and how each group relies on scripture to ground their assertions. Follow the discussion prompt below.  

[Climate Change: An Evangelical Call to Action](http://web.archive.org/web/20110725170828/http://christiansandclimate.org/learn/call-to-action/)

[The Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation: Open Letter](http://www.cornwallalliance.org/climateletter2015/)

DISCUSSION:

Name two specific differences between these positions and the justifications offered for each. Which perspective do you think is most persuasive and why?  Please share your responses in the discussion board and respond to the posts of at least two of your peers. 

## Religion and Evolution

RELIGION AND EVOLUTION

In Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism, there are groups that believe that Darwin’s theory of evolution contradicts their religious convictions.  Among these, many challenge the legitimacy of Darwin’s theory itself.  There are many other groups within these traditions that see little to no tension between their embrace of evolution and their religious convictions.  

The link below will take you to an overview of positions representing several Christian groups and broad, summative statements on Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism published by the Pew Research Center.  In addition to the summaries, the Pew research team has provided links for further exploration under each tradition.  Please review at least three entries (with attendant articles) and keep in mind the questions we’ve been exploring regarding interpretation, power, and representation.  Which voices are prominent and which marginalized and why?  On a related note, what does it mean that Christianity is divided into several sub categories while Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism only have one entry each?
