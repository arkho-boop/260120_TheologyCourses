## WELCOME TO DAY 2

All of us on the teaching team are thrilled with the quality of your reflections and interactions thus far.  We are inspired by your thoughtfulness, generosity with your peers, and willingness to learn new ways to think about religion. 

We'll continue our explorations here in day two as we move into engagement with the  cultural studies method.  You'll be introduced to this framework in the materials ahead, but for now I want to comment on the challenges that several of you spoke about regarding frustrations with the discussion board.  The sheer volume of responses coupled with the somewhat limited functionality of this aspect of the edX platform is posing a challenge that we on the teaching team are hard at work at addressing.  Please don't lose heart!  As you know, in my view the interactive opportunity that the course provides is one of the most important aspects of this learning experience. We are committed to making it as user friendly as satisfying as possible and will be back in touch with you as soon as we have suggestions to share.  

In the meantime, please remember to post in your the discussion board and continue to share your insights, questions, and ideas in the discussion threads.  Finally, please consider posting your own responses to the prompts BEFORE reading the responses of others.  It is easy to lose your train of thought in reaction to the comments of others and we're eager to hear from everyone.  

Thank you, and I look forward to your ongoing participation!

Professor Moore

## Reading: Methodological Assumptions Part 2

### METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS REGARDING RELIGION

Part Two

Diane L. Moore, Harvard Divinity School, 2015

CULTURAL STUDIES

The cultural studies approach to understanding religion that forms the analytical and methodological foundation for this course assumes the basic elements of the study of religion outlined in Part One and frames them within a postmodern worldview with the following specific characteristics.

First, the method is multi and inter-disciplinary and recognizes how political, economic, and cultural lenses are fundamentally entwined rather than discrete. For example, economic or political dimensions of human experience cannot be accurately understood without understanding the religious and other ideological influences that shape the cultural context out of which particular political or economic actions and motivations arise. This is the methodological framework related to the third tenet of religious studies in Part One: that religions are embedded in culture and that “culture” is inclusive of political and economic influences. 

Second, the method assumes that all knowledge claims are "situated" in that they arise out of particular social/historical contexts and therefore represent particular rather than universally applicable claims. This notion of "situatedness" is drawn from historian of science Donna Haraway's assertion that "situated knowledges" are more accurate than the "god-trick" of universal or objective claims that rest on the assumption that it is possible to "see everything from nowhere." Contrary to popular opinion, the recognition that all knowledge claims are "situated" is not a manifestation of relativism whereby all interpretations are considered equally valid. Rather, "situated knowledges" offer the firmest ground upon which to make objective claims that are defined not by their detachment but rather by their specificity, transparency and capacity for accountability. 

Regarding the study of religion, this understanding of "situatedness" offers a tool to recognize that religious claims are no different than other forms of interpretation in that they arise out of particular contexts that represent particular assumptions as opposed to absolute, universal and ahistorical truths. (For example, claims such as "Islam is a religion of peace" and "Islam promotes terrorism" are equally problematic and need to be recognized as particular theological assertions as opposed to ultimate Truths.)   

Third, this notion of situatedness applies to the texts and materials being investigated, the scholarly interpreters of those materials, and all inquirers regardless of station. The method recognizes that all forms of inquiry are interpretations filtered through particular lenses. By acknowledging this fact, an essential dimension of the inquiry itself is to identify those differing lenses and make transparent that which would otherwise be hidden. 

Fourth, the method calls for an analysis of power and powerlessness related to the subject at hand. Which perspectives are politically and socially prominent and why? Which are marginalized or silenced and why? Regarding religion, why are some theological interpretations more prominent than others in relationship to specific issues in particular social/historical contexts? For example, what are the factors that led to the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan and why did their interpretation of the role of women in Islam, for example, gain social legitimacy over other competing claims within the tradition itself? 

In another vein, what are the converging factors that lend social credibility and influence to some religious traditions over others and which dimensions of those traditions are interpreted as orthodox and which heretical and by whom? What were the conditions that allowed Muslims, Christians and Jews to live together in relative harmony in medieval Spain and what are the religious influences that have contributed to shaping contemporary tensions in the Middle East and more globally regarding the "war on terror" and “the Arab Spring”? 

Fifth, this approach highlights what cultural anthropologists know well: that cultural norms are fluid and socially constructed even though they are often interpreted as representing uncontested absolute truths. This dynamic tension is powerfully demonstrated in social science theorist Johan Galtung’s three-pronged typology of violence/peace. This framework also provides an excellent foundation for discerning and representing the varied ideological influences of religions in human affairs. We'll be focusing on Galtung's work in Day Three of our module.

## Discussion: Method Document Part 2

METHODS DISCUSSION

Please share your general responses to Part Two of the Methods document focusing on the cultural studies approach. Is this way to think about religion new to you?  What do you find compelling or challenging about this approach? Please share your responses in the discussion board and respond to at least two of your peers.  

## Embedded: Perception Exercise

PERCEPTION EXERCISE 

Thank you for reading and responding to Part Two of the Methods document.  The following activity has two parts and is designed to represent dimensions of the cultural studies model.   In part one, please respond to the following prompts with notes to yourself.  Don’t post these yet, and don’t do any research before answering.  Part of the exercise is about perception.  

What is your perception of 

- the religious make-up of your nation today? 

- the religious make-up of your nation (or geographical region) in 1900?

- the religious make-up of your nation (or geographical region) in 1400?

Check your answers against the data below and respond to the discussion prompts. 

Did your own assumptions align with the information provided?  If so, what are the sources of your information?  If not, what are the sources of your assumptions?  What does this exercise reveal about embedded perceptions about religion?  Please post your answers in the discussion board and respond to at least two of your peers.

## Discussion: Forces of Change

DISCUSSION ON FORCES OF CHANGE

For part two of the perception exercise, please comment on your thoughts regarding the forces of change or continuity that the historical data on religion in your country or region reveals.  If there was substantial change in the religious population, what were the causes?  If there is substantial continuity, were there outside forces threatening that continuity that were thwarted?  What do these dynamics reveal about the roles religions play in political life?  How does power manifest itself in these dynamics?  There is no need to do research to answer these questions.  We are asking you to ponder and speculate about dynamics vs. research actual causes as a way to represent how religions function in integrated vs. isolated ways in human experience.  Please post your responses in the Discussion board and respond to at least two of your peers.

## Activity: Worldview Autobiography

WORLDVIEW AUTOBIOGRAPHY

We'll continue to explore all aspects of the cultural studies approach in exercises throughout this module.  For now, we'll return to what Donna Haraway calls "situatedness" and the importance of recognizing the ways that our cultural contexts and experiences shape our perceptions.  The last exercise introduced this idea in a more general way, and we'll now turn to exploring the role of situatedness in the context of our own lives.  In relationship to religion, this understanding invites consideration of the following types of questions:  What are the sources of your information about religion?  What perspectives do they represent?  What perspectives are not included?  How do your assumptions about religion, and/or your experiences with religion shape your perceptions?  What sources about religion do you consider trustworthy or valid and which ones are suspect and why?  

In order to begin to apply the idea of “situatedness” to our own personal contexts, I would like you to prepare and share what we are calling a short worldview autobiography.  How do you self identify regarding religious affiliation or worldview and who are the most influential people in your life who have shaped your views?  What significant experiences have you had that impact your understanding of religion?  Do you identify as an atheist? A humanist? An evangelical Christian?  A devotee of the Goddess?  An Ismaili Muslim?  Is your self-identity the same or different than your parents or your grandparents?  If different, what influences were significant to you? 

The purpose of this exercise is to highlight our individual “situatedness” and the ways that our perceptions are shaped by our social, cultural, geographical, and historical contexts.  Your autobiography can be written or represented artistically.  Please see the examples we’ve provided below to give you a taste of the range of ways to respond to these prompts. 

We'd like you to now create your own worldview autobiography.  You can do so in 250 words or less or through an artistic representation of some kind that can be shared (e.g., a pictorial collage, a short video, a poem, etc.)  Do your views differ from your parents?  From your grandparents?  How do you think your background and assumptions impact your interpretations of religion?  After you submit your answer in the Discussion board, view and comment on at least two other posts from your peers. 
EXAMPLES OF WORLDVIEW BIOGRAPHIES

Danelle B.

I do not exclusively identify with a particular religion. My inter-faith is rooted in a concept of the Universe that is governed in union by a Goddess (feminine) and God (masculine) energy/deities. There are aspects of the seven main world religions that I agree and disagree with. To my knowledge, my religious identity is different from my family. That is not to say that my understanding of their identities did not have great influence upon the development of mine. My mother’s side of the family mainly identifies as Baptist. Although, I became curious about the religious identity of my matrilineal Native American ancestors and Celtic paganism at an early age. I did not spend much time with my father and paternal family growing up. I comprehended around third grade that some of them identified as Jewish. Shortly after realizing, I told a classmate I was half-Jewish like him. He laughed and told me I was not Jewish because I was black and that in order to be a true Jew, my mom had to be Jewish. That early experience hurt and confused me about the perceived relationships between race, religion and faith. However, it fueled my quest to find and understand my religious and self identity. By middle school, I began to research religions on my own. In high school, I was exposed to various types of religions through the friends that I made and their families. Such experiences came to inform and shape the foundations of my religious identity.

As we walked into the church during my earliest memories, I found myself surrounded by the most beautiful statues and stained glass windows within cathedral style ceilings.  My family attended one of the most beautiful Catholic churches in my hometown.  The Catholic church required many prescribed rituals of standing, kneeling, dipping your fingers in holy water, and taking communion of bread and wine from the priest to commemorate the sacrifices of Christ.  When I arrived in graduate school at Ohio State University, professors encouraged me to think independently and follow my own beliefs.  This led me to question my family’s religious assumptions.  Did my religious background align with my values?  I decided to explore other religions.  The religion most aligned with my worldview is called the Society of Friends, also known as the Quakers.  I appreciated their belief in a direct connection with God without prescribed rituals, their support of women and other minorities in education, and their vow of simplicity.  My situatedness still represented the majority religion in the United States, called Christianity.  In another epiphany of life several years later, I decided to explore world religions here at Harvard, such as Buddhism, Judaism, Hinduism, and Islam.  I trusted the Harvard Divinity School and our professors to share trustworthy and diverse information about religion.  My classes at Harvard shaped my perception to love all religions.  All religions have the common goal to guide human thoughts and behaviors in a positive way according to each religion’s unique worldview.

The left side of the drawing represents my life now, the components and aspects of my life that I have constructed and fostered. The background is flannel, which represents a component of the stereotypical lesbian life that I tend to lead… it’s always there in the background. The foreground of the image holds the lenses by which I see the world. Buddhist, Anarchist, Gender Queer, Sexuality, Chican@ and Sex- all of which influence the way I approach the world. Also in the foreground are three components that I feel are important to a happy life: Love, passion (represented by flames) and being a pacifist (represented by the peace symbol). The conscious effort I make to construct a life full of these components also influences my politics and attitude in everyday interactions.

The right side of the drawing is really the background of the picture. The flannel is simply covering it. This chaos, an electrical storm of sorts, acts like a fuel for the social and religious structures that were the building blocks of my family and childhood. Though there are no words, the pattern in the middle of the storm could have the following words attached to it: Pentecostal, Heterosexual, Confining, Smothering, and Girl. While I fill my life presently, through education and life experience, with certain lenses, the right side of my background always informs the lenses on the left.

My worldview is deeply informed by my religion and education. I am a member of the ELCA, the most liberal branch of the Lutheran churches in the United States. I am comfortable in this organization in large part because of the liberal political and social stances that the ELCA takes. I personally see Lutheranism as a religion that helps move progressive social change, one that has instilled values in me including accepting others, questioning, doubting, and interpreting scripture for myself. More specifically, I am a Midwestern, Norwegian Lutheran. This ethnoreligious heritage comes from my ancestors, most of whom emigrated to the Midwest from Norway in the 19th century. The hymns, foodways, festivals, and other Norwegian religious traditions that I celebrate today connect me to my family and my heritage. My faith and ethnic identity are inextricably tied together.

My worldview is also informed by my education; I have degrees in Religious Studies and Near Eastern Studies from the University of British Columbia, and am currently working towards a Master of Divinity degree here at Harvard Divinity School. My research interests include understanding the social worlds in which the Abrahamic religions originated and combatting the religious illiteracy which causes so many misunderstandings in our world. The methods of religious literacy taught in this course have thus become a part of my worldview as well, and I am so excited to be a part of the team that is bringing this information to you!

In short, my situatedness is rooted in both my ethnoreligious heritage as a liberal Norwegian Lutheran of the Midwestern United States, and my always continuing education in the ever- changing, diverse, and interconnected world of religion.

Eli B.

I grew up in a house where there was often many mixed messages regarding beliefs in the Ukrainian Orthodox religion and the Irish Protestant religion.  Today if someone asked me what my religious denomination is I would have difficulty answering them.  I would often tell people I was Christian, but as I grew older I knew that I was not.  I could not belong to the Christian faith, nor could I dishonor it with a lack of devotion or conviction.  I did believe that there was some kind of force or superior being and this probably resulted from the experiences in my own home growing up.  My parents were a strong influence in my life and have helped shape my worldviews.  Coming from a mixed religious background I have seen the beauty in both my parents’ religions.  Although my upbringing did not include regular practice of these religions many of the beliefs my parents held were passed on to me in explicit and implicit ways. As the world around us changes and evolves so do our beliefs. My parents did not have access to higher education, mass communications, and travel which I believe influence our views profoundly.

I consider myself to be a humanist. I do not believe that religion defines us, but religion does influence our worldviews and opinions of people, events, and life in general. I believe our innate desire to collectively evolve together as we ponder the human experience and question of our existence is what truly defines us.
