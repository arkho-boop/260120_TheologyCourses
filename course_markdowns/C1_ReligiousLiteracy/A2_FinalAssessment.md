# Assessment 2: Final Assessment

FINAL MODULE ASSESSMENT: 

Please choose one of the following three options as an opportunity to synthesize your learning in this module. 

**Option One: Learning Bridge**

If you are continuing on to one or more of the future modules of this course, describe how your perspectives as a learner will be informed by your work in this module. Choose one or more elements of the course methodology (as outlined in the first three sessions of this module) that particularly resonated with you and describe how it will inform the understandings, questions, approaches, and learning goals you will bring to the scripture and religious tradition or traditions you will study next.

**Option Two: Design a Learning Experience using Course Resource(s)**

Use resources from the course (one or more readings or videos) to share a piece of content and/or methodology with a particular audience in your community. This might be a lesson plan to employ in a classroom teaching context, or a learning experience to facilitate in an informal learning environment or community group. (Examples include but are not limited to formal classroom settings in K-12 or higher education contexts, religious education classes in religious settings, interfaith or intrafaith groups, book groups, neighborhood gatherings, summer camps, etc.)

Start by describing the learning context, intended audience, and why you think this particular element of the course is important to share with them. 

Then, list the steps of your plan in bullet form along with links to the resources you are using so that others will be able to replicate your ideas.  

**Option Three: Choose a Scripture Case Study**

In the final session of this module you looked at multiple interpretations of narrative from the biblical story of Exodus, as informed by differing situated identities, relationships to power, and political and historical contexts. Choose another piece of scripture from any religious tradition, provide examples of at least two diverse interpretations of it, and a brief commentary on the contexts that gave rise to those interpretations. 

Please post your commentary and do a **PEER REVIEW** of two other posts that will be randomly assigned to you. Once you respond to your peers, your own post will be made available for you to review with comments from two others. **Commentaries should be no more than 500 words long.**
