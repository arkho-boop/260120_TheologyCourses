## Welcome to Day 6

WELCOME TO DAY 6

Greetings to all!

Today, we'll explore issues related to canon and canon formation through a variety of examples.  You'll see that the very idea of canon is not a uniform concept among or even within traditions.  As always, we are looking forward to hearing your thoughtful responses to the content and to each other as we continue our exploration together.  

We also hope that you'll join us for one of the live discussion forums scheduled for Friday, March 18 at 10:00am and 3:00pm EDT.  (Please note that we changed from being on EST to EDT this past week and so we moved our clocks an hour forward. Convert to your own time zone here.)   Even if you are new to the course or still working on earlier days of the module, you are welcome to join us!  We always keep the prompt general to accommodate participants in all phases of the class. The prompt is "Please be prepared to name and discuss 1-3 things that you've learned thus far in the course that you find especially compelling or challenging." 

Thanks again for all your contributions.

Professor Moore

## Activity: Readings on the Canon in Buddhism and Christianity

CANON FORMATION: BUDDHISM AND CHRISTIANITY

In the first part of today’s readings we will look at formation of canon in two religious traditions: Buddhism and Christianity.  

First, you may want to review the reading on [Theravada Buddhism](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/theravada.html) that you encountered in the previous session on orality and scripture. This time, direct your attention to how the process described in this article constitutes the formation of an authoritative body of scripture. 

Next, let's look at two other approaches to canon within Buddhist tradition. First, the primarily Tibetan Buddhist [tradition of ongoing revelation known as Terma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terma_(religion)). How does change over time, through the revelation of "earth terma" and "mind terma," relate to understandings of scripture and authority within the tradition? Finally, review this short description of [Mahayana Buddhism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mahayana). What relationship to the notion of canon is described here?      

Now we’ll turn our attention to an early moment of canon formation within Christian tradition. In the Christianity module itself, you will learn more about internal diversity of canons within modern Christianity.  For now,  we'll read about the [earliest emergence of scriptural canon](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/story/emergence.html). This page includes both a short summary from Elaine Pagels and an interview with L. Michael White. As you read, please consider what forces led to the formation of early Christian canon. What forms of authority shaped which texts were included and which were excluded?   

This reading references the proliferation of diverse texts within early Christian communities. Let’s also look closer at one of these texts: the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas. See [here for reflections](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/story/thomas.html) on this enigmatic text from Elaine Pagels and Helmut Koester and here for [a full text](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/maps/primary/gthomas.html) of the 114 sayings that make up the gospel. How does this non-canonical text relate to the gospels that became part of the Christian canon?

## Discussion: Personal Response

DISCUSSION

What did you learn about the formation of canon, and the role of texts that exist outside of canon, within these two traditions? How does this relate to your own understanding of canon within the traditions and cultural contexts with which you are most familiar? How does the notion of canon connect with our goals of understanding religious traditions as internally diverse and historically dynamic?   

Provide your thoughts in the Discussion board and respond to the thoughts of at least two of your peers.

## Discussion: Poetry and Scripture

DISCUSSION: POETRY AND SCRIPTURE

In the next part of today’s session we will look at examples of poetic devotional expression and consider how these artistic expressions relate to canonical scripture in those traditions. 

On the discussion board, briefly describe your associations with the words “poetry” and “scripture.” Do your associations overlap? Why or why not? 

## Devotional Poetry

POETRIC EXPRESSIONS IN MUSLIM AND HINDU TRADITIONS

The cultural studies approach invites particular attention to religious voices through artistic and literary expression. Up to this point in the course we have focused on examples of visual artistic expression; in the readings and video below you will explore two examples poetic devotional expression in Islamic and Hindu tradition. Although these traditions may not be part of scriptural canon, they are significance texts in the lived experience of practitioners. How does this lived experience of religious writings inform our understanding of the role of canon, and non-canonical texts, in studying religious texts? As you read, pay particular attention both to this role of poetry in religious life, and to the importance of the geographic and cultural context from which the writings emerged.    

Co-authored by Professor Ali Asani who will lead the Islam module of this course, *Celebrating Muhammad: Images of the Prophet in Popular Muslim Poetry* explores devotional poetry in Egyptian and Indo-Muslim context. Here you will read [the introduction and opening description of the latter tradition from Celebrating Muhammad](https://sites.la.utexas.edu/mhc/files/2009/10/asani-celebrating_muhammad.pdf), via the University of Texas. **Focus on pages 10-45**. 

Authored by Professor Neelima Shukla-Bhatt who will lead the Hinduism module of this course, “[Narasinha Mehta of Gujarat](https://books.google.com/books?id=SnXDBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Narasinha+Mehta+of+Gujarat+:+a+legacy+of+bhakti+in+songs+and+stories&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigieae7s3KAhXJ2R4KHcxMCoUQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&q&f=false)” explores the devotional poetry of a saint-poet from medieval north India. *Starting on page 1, read available selections from the introduction*. *Celebrating Muhammad* speaks about the influence of Indian poetic tradition on these Islamic practices. What connections do you see?

Below you will also find a video of a hymn by Narasinha Mehta that was a favorite of Gandhi's. Underneath the video you can read a translation of this hymn into English by Professor Shukla-Bhatt.

**Vaishnava jana to**

Call only that one a true Vaishnava, who understands others’ pain,

who helps them in their suffering,

but has no arrogance in his heart. The one

who bows to everyone in the world,

and speaks ill of none,

who is unwavering in speech, action, and thought, truly blessed is his mother!

The one

who sees everyone as equal, and has given up desires,

who views another’s wife as mother, whose tongue does not lie,

who does not touch another’s wealth, who is not bound by illusory attachments,

whose detachment is firm,

and whose heart is immersed in Ram’s name. all places of pilgrimage are within his body.

The one

who is without greed or deceit,

who has subdued anger and lust, on seeing that one, says Narasainyo:

seventy-one generations are saved.

(translation Neelima Shukla-Bhatt)

## Discussion: Devotional Poetry

DISCUSSION

For the discussion board choose one sentence from your reading on the previous page that highlights a theme of particular interest to you about the relationship between poetic writing and religious tradition. Include the sentence in your post, as well as your own commentary on its significance and what about it was interesting to you. You might pick a broad theme, such as the relationship between devotional poetry and cultural / regional context, or the relationship between devotional poetry and more canonical scripture. Or, you might pick a quote that speaks to specific themes and content of the poetry.
