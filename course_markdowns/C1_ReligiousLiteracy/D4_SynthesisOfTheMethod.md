## Welcome to Day 4

WELCOME TO DAY 4

We're nearly halfway through our module and we on the teaching team continue to be inspired by your enthusiasm for the course and your thoughtful engagement with your peers.  Thank you!  

Here in day 4 you'll have the opportunity to synthesize your learning thus far through three activities and a mid-module assessment found in a separate tab under the day 4 link on the left.  We hope all of these exercises will help you deepen your understanding of the cultural studies method we've been exploring.  On Day 5 we'll begin to apply this method specifically to issues and illustrations related to scriptures.

The decision to increase the number of discussion threads seems to have enhanced opportunities for more responsive interactions among you all and we hope you agree.   Please remember that we've also added another live discussion section on Friday, March 11 at 10:00am EST in addition to the one previously scheduled at 3:00pm EST. I hope all of you who are interested in these live discussions opportunities will be able to attend one of these sessions. Our prompt for this week is the same as option two for the mid-module assessment:  Use the following intro line: "Did you know...?" and complete the question with an idea or fact that you've learned so far that you find especially compelling and important for others to know. Be prepared to share a brief comment on why you find it compelling and why others should care. We look forward to seeing you then!

Thanks again for your continued engagement with the course and with each other.  It is a pleasure and privilege to be on this journey together.  

Professor Moore

## Activity: Religious Literacy Project

COUNTRY PROFILES: Examples of the Method

Please explore one of the Religious Literacy Project country profiles linked below and offer your reflections in the discussion board about how it represents the cultural studies method we’ve been exploring.  What did you learn that surprised you?  How does this representation of the role of religions in social, political, and cultural life enhance your understanding of historical and contemporary dynamics? You may wish to read the opening section of the country profile and then skim or choose from the sub-sections below.

## Video: Methods and Scripture

## Examples: Interpretations of the Ramayana

CASE STUDY: Interpreting the Ramayana

Let’s return to the Ramayana, the Hindu epic that we first learned about in day one.  Please start by rereading [the introductory article by Professor Vinay Lal](https://southasia.ucla.edu/) to refresh your memory. Next please read [this short case study](https://rpl.hds.harvard.edu/religion-context/case-studies/violence-peace/destruction-ayodhya-mosque) on the decades long dispute over a space deemed sacred to both Muslims and Hindus in Ayodhya, India. 

Discussion:

For this exercise, please note how issues of power and influence function in the history of how the Ramayana is interpreted and received.  What is at stake in this debate and how does this case study represent the themes we’ve been exploring such as internal diversity, evolution and change, and the ways that religions are not isolated from political, social, and cultural life? Please post your response in the Discussion forum and respond to the posts of at least two of your peers.

## Case Study: Sufism, Music, and Controversy in Pakistan

[The Rock Star and the Mullahs](https://vimeo.com/98242253) is a 53 minute documentary produced in 2003 about the lead singer Salman Ahmad from the Pakistani Rock Band Junoon.   Mr. Ahmad returned to his home in Pakistan to speak with conservative religious leaders who argue that music is forbidden in Islam. As you view the video, make special note of the different interpretations of the Qur'an that are represented as well as the issues surrounding what is deemed to be appropriate expressions of devotion.

Discussion:

What captured your attention in this video?  Name at least one of the central controversies regarding interpretation and discuss how issues of power are at play.  Use Galtung's typologies to help identify underlying cultural norms and how they reinforce cultural forms of both violence and peace.
