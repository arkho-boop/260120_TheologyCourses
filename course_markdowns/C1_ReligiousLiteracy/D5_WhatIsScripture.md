# Day 5: What is Scripture?

- [Day 5: What is Scripture?](#day-5-what-is-scripture)

## Welcome to Day 5

WELCOME TO DAY 5

Here at the halfway marker of our Religious Literacy Module, we'll now turn to applying the methods we've explored to examples related to scripture. We’ll begin by asking what forms scripture can take, and by reflecting on our own associations and assumptions about them.  We hope you enjoy the examples we've provided, and look forward to hearing your responses to the content and to one another.

## Discussion: Imagine Scriptures

DISCUSSION:

What came to mind when you imagined scripture or someone engaging with scripture?  What elements of your "situatedness," your own worldview, background, and context do you think influenced your answer? Please respond to this question in the Discussion board and respond to at least two posts from your peers.  

## Examples: Oral Tradition

ORAL TRADITIONS

All of the religions represented in this course have deep traditions of experiencing scripture through singing, chanting, and speaking. The readings and video resources below explore different forms of oral scripture. You will learn more about each of these practices in future modules, but for now notice what stands out to you personally, and what connections you can make to the cultural studies method.

1. Watch and listen to two examples of Qur'anic recitation. English translations by Munjed Murad using HarperCollins Study Qur'an are provided via closed captioning to the right of the videos. Oral and aural experience play a central role in encounter with the central text of Islam, the Qur'an. For a short introduction to this tradition and its contemporary manifestations, read the first two pages and the section titled "The Qur'an as Recitation" on pages 11-13 of “[Approaching the Qur’an](http://sites.la.utexas.edu/mhc/files/2009/10/sells-approaching_the_quran.pdf)” by Michael Sells, a scholar of religion and comparative literature. How does Sells describe the experience of recitation as differing from experience of the text as a book of bound pages? For deeper context read the full introduction, which outlines ideas you will encounter in the later Islam module.  

(Please excuse the santa hat in the video thumbnail - YouTube occasionally makes some very strange choices for what should be shown before the video plays.) 

**Shaykh Mustafa Ismail, Recitation of section of Surat al-Isra' (translated: The Night Journey)**

2. The Vedas are the most ancient and authoritative Hindu texts, and it is through oral tradition of memorization and recitation that they have been preserved through millennia. In this next video we will listen to a short introduction and hear some examples of Vedic chanting in Hindu tradition. Please follow this link to watch [The Tradition of Vedic Chanting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPcasmn0cRU&t=87s), from UNESCO.


The next two examples you will read, rather than hear, the relationship between text and oral tradition.  

3. Theravada is one of the major schools of Buddhism. In [this introductory article](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/theravada.html) read the sections under the headers "Many Buddhisms, One Dhamma-vinaya," and "Pali: The Language of Theravada Buddhism." Pay attention to the role that oral tradition has played in the development of its scriptural tradition over time. How does historical interplay between spoken and written language inform both the origins of this religious tradition and ways in which it is understood today?   

4. Finally, the two short excerpts below reflect on the nature of the Oral Torah in Jewish tradition.

*A survey of sources reveals that the rabbis understood the oral character of the Oral Torah in (at least) two different ways. On the one hand, some rabbinic sources highlight the fact that the Oral Torah was passed on orally from Sinai to the rabbis in an unbroken chain of transmission. In these sources, the distinctive feature of Oral Torah is that it is conveyed by word of mouth and memorized. On the other hand, other sources focus on Oral Torah as teachings that are unfolded through intensive analysis, interrogation, and debate. In these sources, the orality of Oral Torah lies more in the oral instructional environment in which traditions are articulated.*

-Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, “The Orality of Rabbinic Writing” in The Cambridge Companion to The Talmud and Rabbinic Literature, 39.
 
*At issue, it should be stressed, is not the existence of an “oral tradition” (or unwritten law), common to all literate cultures, but the attribution of revealed status and authority to the specifically rabbinic Oral Torah…they do not understand Oral Torah’s status and authority to be secondarily derived from the Written Torah. Rather, as traditions revealed at Sinai, Oral Torah in their eyes has legal authority in its own right.*

-Steven Fraade, “Concepts of Scripture in Rabbinic Judaism,” in Jewish Concepts of Scripture: A Comparative Introduction, 33.

## Examples: Materiality and Scripture

MATERIALITY AND SCRIPTURE

Next we will look at some examples of scripture within visual and material culture. How does physical and temporal context inform encounters with scripture as something that is seen, held, worn, and integrated into space and place?    

1. First, view the images and read the accompanying essay from the [Metropolitan Museum of Art](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/tali/hd_tali.htm) on the tradition of Amulets and Talismans in the Islamic World. How do practitioners experience text as mediated through these objects?   
2. Next, view images and read the description of a contemporary example of [Buddhist scriptures as object](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jkim/files/j_kim_2018_chap_16_illustrated_buddhist_manuscripts.pdf) at a local Buddhist resource center here in Cambridge, Massachusetts. What connections do you see between this and the prior examples? How does historical context, in this case contemporary technology, shape the relationship between scripture and materiality here? 
3. Finally, in the talk below, authors Adina Hoffman and Peter Cole discuss their book “Sacred Trash: The Lost and Found World of the Cairo Geniza.” In Jewish tradition, a geniza is a sacred storage room connected to synagogues or burial grounds where worn or damaged sacred texts are stored prior to proper ritual burial.  In this talk, Hoffman and Cole discuss one such cache kept by the medieval Jewish community of Cairo. Watch from minute **8:10 - 12:35** of their conversation in the video below. How does materiality inform the relationship between practitioners and text in this context?

## Discussion: Personal Response

DISCUSSION

In the discussion below, please choose **two examples** to focus on from the prior pages looking at oral and material traditions in scripture. First, describe the relationship between scripture and religious practitioners represented in the examples you chose. Note what resonated with, differed from, or challenged, your own associations with scripture. How do these ways of engaging with text inform or challenge your understanding of what it means to study and understand scripture in diverse contexts? Please post your response in the Discussion board and comment on the posts of at least two of your peers.

## Video: eL Seed Calligraffiti

eL SEED: CALLIGRAFFITI

For our final example, we will hear from the French-Tunisian “Calligraffiti” artist, eL Seed, whose work blends contemporary street art with classical Arabic calligraphy. In this short TED talk below he discusses how his work both relates to, and transforms, space, place, and text. (Optional: Watch [an additional short video](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/where-art-blends-with-activism/) in which eL Seed discusses the significance of a piece he created on Harvard's campus following the Tunisian revolution.)

## Activity: Field of Vision

DISCUSSION:

As we began to explore in day 2 of this course, the arts offer a critical point of entry to understandings of diversity, dynamism, and the role of "situatedness" in religious tradition. For the final response to today's material:  

1. Choose a piece of eL Seed’s work, either from the prior video or [his website](https://elseed-art.com/), and first describe your own experience of it. EL Seed talks about his decision not to translate the Arabic text in his art; how is your response informed by your ability or inability to “read” the text in a traditional sense? 

2. In “Religion, Art, and Visual Culture,” scholar S. Brent Plate describes the “field of vision” that contextualizes visual art and other images that appear in public life. He describes this field as being composed of: 

a. The image itself 
b. The form or medium of the image; the relationship between medium and message, or form and content
c. The identity of the creator
d. The language that surrounds the image
e. The responses to it
f. The historical context in which the image was created and has been viewed
g. The identity of the viewers
h. The cultural crossings related to the image, and 
i. The social, political and cultural institutions surrounding it.  

While you may not be able to speak to each of these components, using the information available to you describe the “field of vision” surrounding the work from eL Seed that you chose. How does this context inform the significance of religious text in this context? How does it inform your own understanding of this use of religious text? Responses should be between 200-400 words.  Please post your response in the Discussion board and respond to the posts of two of your peers.
