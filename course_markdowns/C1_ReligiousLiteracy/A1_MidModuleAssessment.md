# Assessment 1: Mid-Module Assessment

MID-MODULE MIDTERM: 

We are halfway through our module on Religious Literacy and I want to pause to give you an opportunity to synthesize your learning by engaging in **ONE** of the following three options below:

**Option One: Evaluate a Media Representation of Religion**

Please choose a contemporary article in the news related to religion from your local or national context and paste a copy of the article or a link to it at the top of your posting. Using the cultural studies method, please briefly respond to the following questions.   

1) Does the article represent the religion or religions in question as internally diverse?

2) If authorities are cited, do you think they are properly chosen?

3) What perspectives of the tradition or traditions are represented?  Are there relevant voices that are not heard? What might change about the article if they were included?

4) Are there other aspects of the article that you think are relevant to comment upon based on the method?

5) In light of your comments,  please rate the quality of the article on a scale from 1-5 (1=poor; 3=average; 5=exceptional). 

**Option Two: Write a Short Commentary on Your Learning**

Use the following intro line: "Did you know...?" and complete the question with an idea or fact that you've learned so far that you find especially compelling and important for others to know.  Share a brief comment on why you find it compelling and why others should care.  

**Option Three: Write a Comparative Commentary on Black Lives Matter and Liberation Theology**

Returning to the Liberation Theology case study from Day Three, comment on the similarities and differences between the assertion "Black Lives Matter" and the "preferential option for the poor" that framed the Latin American Liberation Theology movement.  Use Galtung's frameworks in your analysis.  

Please post your commentary and do a **PEER REVIEW** of two other posts that will be randomly assigned to you. Once you respond to your peers, your own post will be made available for you to review with comments from two others. ***Commentaries should be no more than 500 words long.***

**Due Date**: You have until the last day of class, September 30, 2016 to complete the mid-term, but we encourage you to finish it quickly in order to keep moving forward with the rest of the class.
