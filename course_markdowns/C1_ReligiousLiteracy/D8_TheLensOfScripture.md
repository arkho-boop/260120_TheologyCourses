## Welcome to Day 8

WELCOME TO DAY 8!

It's hard to believe that this is our last day of the religious literacy module.  Congratulations to all of you who have come this far in the course! 

In this final session, we will consider the opportunities and challenges of using scripture as a way to study world religions. What does this lens both reveal and conceal about the larger realities of these traditions? We'll close with a synthesis exercise, a more extended learning summary, and three options to choose from for your final assessment.  As always, we hope you'll find the material compelling and we look forward to following your progress.

## Activity: Annotation Exercise

READING EXERCISE: EXODUS 13:17-15:21

For our first exercise, we will focus on one piece of scripture from the Jewish and Christian traditions as a case study: [Exodus 13:17-15:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+13%3A17-15%3A21&version=NRSV).  Before we begin examining other interpretive voices, we want to give you the chance to reflect upon your own interpretation of this text and to ponder what elements of your own situated identity and context inform your response. Please read carefully and make note of the sections that capture your attention. What does this text mean to you? How do you interpret it from the context of your larger worldview or experience of the world? 

## Activity: Readings and Images

**EXODUS INTERPRETED**

Drawing on the work of Scott M. Langston in *Exodus Through the Centuries*, we will now look at how Exodus 13:17-15:21 has been interpreted in vastly different (at times entirely oppositional) ways in different contexts and from different situated perspectives in American history. Writing in the edited volume *African-American Christianity,* the historian Albert J. Raboteau characterizes some of these strikingly different American experiences of the text in this way: 

``“From the earliest days of colonization, white Christians had represented their journey across the Atlantic to America as the exodus of a New Israel from the bondage of Egypt into the Promised Land of milk and honey. For black Christians, the imagery was reversed: the Middle Passage had brought them to Egypt land, where they suffered bondage under a new Pharaoh. White Christians saw themselves as the New Israel; slaves identified themselves as the Old.”  ``

Below you will find several primary and secondary source readings, as well as pieces of visual art. Please review them all, and in the upcoming writing response you will be asked to **pick two** to think about in depth. 

- Description of the 1776 [Great Seal Committee](http://www.greatseal.com/committees/firstcomm/)
- Short essay about rebellion slave leader [Denmark Vesey](http://www.pbs.org/thisfarbyfaith/people/denmark_vesey.html) (webcapture cache from PBS series) 
- [Thomas Dew’s 1832 Pro-Slavery Argument](http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3401804763.html)
- Text of Rabbi Abraham Heschel’s 1963 address “[Religion and Race](http://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/heschel-religion-and-race-speech-tex).”  
- Isac Friedlander, 1931 Wood Engraving on Paper, [Exodus](http://thejewishmuseum.org/collection/5491-exodus).  

In the words of Langston in *Exodus through the Centuries*, “Artistic depictions have often helped others identify with a particular group’s exodus by confronting non-members with that group’s plight and challenging them to respond. In 1931 Isac Friendlander, who had emigrated to the United States from Latvia, produced a wood engraving entitled *Exodus*. Friedlander, a Jew, was undoubtedly familiar with the biblical story, but instead of portraying an Israelite or Jewish exodus, he depicts all the characters as African American.” (156)

- Howard Cook, 1946 aquatint on paper, [Exodus](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/musart/x-1950-sl-2.8/*).

Again, from Langston: “The scene itself was inspired by an experience Cook had while serving as an artist correspondent with American troops in New Caledonia during World War II. After driving up a road through a jungle canyon and then climbing up a trail, Cook observed a small group of free French soldiers struggling up the path. He was so impressed that he sketched it the next day.” (157) 

## Discussion: Readings and Images Response

DISCUSSION: EXODUS INTERPRETED

Please pick two examples from the prior activity to reflect upon in conversation with one another. 

First, offer a personal response. What stood out to you, or surprised you? How do these readings compare to your own encounter with the text in the annotation exercise? 

Next, connect to the cultural studies framework. What elements of the historical, social, and political context inform each response to the text? How do you see religion and cultural mutually informing one another here? Please post your response in the Discussion board and respond to the posts of at least two of your peers.  

## Examples: Religious Contexts

LIMITS OF SCRIPTURE FOR UNDERSTANDING TRADITIONS: HINDUISM AND BUDDHISM

The preceding example demonstrated that while text can be a powerful lens into teaching and learning about religion, a wider understanding of the contexts in which the text is encountered and understood is critical. Additionally, it is important to remember that large parts of religious worldview and experience are not centered in text. Embodied practice, ritual, worship, service, and more are all deeply important elements of religious experience for many individuals and communities. While this is true across religious traditions, here you will explore examples within Hindu and Buddhists traditions. 

Hinduism: Under the category “[The Hindu Experience](https://pluralism.org/hinduism)” in Harvard’s Pluralism Project website, you will find short videos, audio clips, images, and essays devoted to different experiential dimensions of Hindu religious life. Click through to at least three of these categories to watch, listen, and read. 

Buddhism: As we learned earlier in our module, Thich Nhat Han is a Vietnamese Buddhist monk who coined the phrase “engaged Buddhism” representing the value of promoting peace through a Buddhist framework.  Please return to the 14 precepts of engaged Buddhism that he named. They can be found [here](https://www.lionsroar.com/the-fourteen-precepts-of-engaged-buddhism/). Please make special note of his first precept that states, in part: “Do not be idolatrous about or bound to any doctrine, theory, or ideology, even Buddhist ones.”  

## Discussion: Scripture as a Lens

DISCUSSION: THE STRENGTHS AND LIMITS OF LEARNING ABOUT RELIGIONS THROUGH THEIR SCRIPTURES

Keeping in mind all the examples we’ve explored together over the past 8 Units, please name a primary strength as well as a primary constraint of learning about religions through their scriptures. Please post your response in the Discussion board and respond to the posts of at least two peers.  

## Case Study Synthesis: Religion, Social Media, and the Power of Discourse

CASE STUDY SYNTHESIS: RELIGION, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND THE POWER OF DISCOURSE

Given our ongoing emphasis throughout this module on the importance of context, we thought it would be fitting to conclude with a focus on the context in which this entire course is being offered as a Massive Open Online Course utilizing the vehicle of the internet for transmission.   We've chosen a case study that focuses on how the internet in general (and social media in particular) can be used to both reinforce as well as challenge one's own religious or worldview convictions.  "[Unfollow](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/conversion-via-twitter-westboro-baptist-church-megan-phelps-roper)" was written by Adrian Chen and published in *The New Yorker* magazine in November, 2015. He tells the story of how Megan Phelps-Roper, a leader in the infamous Westboro Baptist Church in the U.S., used social media to spread the beliefs of the group and what happened when some responded to and engaged with her in return. The article is relatively long compared to most readings in our module, but we encourage you to read it in its entirety. There is also a video embedded in the article featuring Megan Phelps-Roper speaking about her experience.  As you read and view, please keep in mind how our social and cultural contexts shape our perspectives, and the courage it takes to both recognize that truth and to be open to engaging meaningfully with others whose perspectives and experiences differ from our own.  

## Discussion: Whole-Hearted and Half-Sure

One of my mentors is [Professor Sharon D. Welch](http://www.meadville.edu/faculty.php) who is currently serving as the Provost and Professor of Religion and Society at Meadville Lombard Seminary in Chicago, Illinois.  She is an ethicist by training, and in one of her earlier books entitled *A Feminist Ethic of Risk* she speaks about the importance holding moral conviction and open mindedness in tension.  To represent this tension, she suggests that in our moral convictions we should strive to be "whole-hearted and half-sure." Adrien Chen's profile of Megan Phelps-Roper represents one example of the courage required to be open to new perspectives and the attendant challenges and opportunities that such openness will inevitably inspire.

As you may recall, one of my primary goals for offering this course was to provide an opportunity for people from diverse perspectives to encounter one another and engage in a constructive way with issues that often divide us. Throughout our experience together, I have witnessed how so many of you have encountered "the other" with openness, genuine curiosity regarding what you might learn, and an abundant generosity. Whether you are a self identified atheist encountering people of faith, a person of faith encountering other perspectives on faith or perspectives skeptical of faith, or a seeker recognizing the importance of situatedness, your willingness to be open to new ideas that might challenge deeply held convictions has been inspiring to me and the entire teaching team. The cultivation of communities where this openness is a central tenet is what I define as a foundational purpose of education, and one of our hopes entering into this MOOC adventure was that we could create such a community of discourse on a global scale. You have proven that this is possible, and the hope you have inspired for us all on the teaching team is difficult to adequately express. Thank you.

In light of the values articulated above, please engage in the following synthesis reflection on this one illustration of the courage to be open to change and the complexities of context and situatedness as represented in Megan Phelps-Roper's story. 

Please begin by highlighting what, if anything, surprised you about her journey. Please close by sharing reflections on **one** of the two following options:  1) Has your experience with the course expanded your own perceptions and assumptions in ways that were/are challenging for you?  If so, please explain; or 2) Please reflect upon the value of the aspiration to be "whole-hearted and half-sure" regarding our moral convictions. Do you agree with this value?  If so, why?  If not, why not?  As always, please post your response in the Discussion board and respond to the posts of two of your peers.  

## Learning Summary

FINAL LEARNING SUMMARY

In preparation for your final discussion prompt, please pause to reflect on all you’ve learned in this module.  Remember that we began by introducing you to a cultural studies approach for enhancing religious literacy that focuses on a way to understand religions that can be applied to specific content about religion.  We reviewed how it is important to distinguish between devotional assertions of belief as true and the exploration of diverse assertions of belief for the nonsectarian study of religion, the method employed in this course.  We also reviewed how religions are internally diverse, how they evolve and change through time and in different cultural and political contexts, and how religions are embedded in all human cultures.  We named and examined the role of interpretation and the particular importance of acknowledging “situated perspectives” to challenge what Donna Haraway calls the “God-trick of assuming you can see everything from nowhere.”  This consciousness makes explorations of power and powerless especially acute, and with the help of Johan Galtung we employed a framework to help discern how some religious assertions rise to prominence in certain contexts while others are marginalized, but still functioning in meaningful ways.  We examined the many ways that religions are embedded in cultures and explored how they influence and are influenced by social and political dynamics.  We finally turned to explore these ways to understand religion with a focus on scripture in several of the worlds religious traditions. We explored the different forms and mediums scripture can take, multiple ways in which bodies of texts grow and change over time, the many ways scripture and devotional writing manifest in the arts, and the power of diverse interpretive voices.    

For this final prompt, please share your reflections regarding your experience of this module.  Specifically, please identify 2-3 things you learned and 2-3 things you’d like to learn more about.  Please also identify 2-3 things you liked about your learning experience and 2-3 suggestions you have to strengthen our module.  Finally, please share any other thoughts you have about your learning experience in the Discussion forum.  We’re eager to hear from you.
